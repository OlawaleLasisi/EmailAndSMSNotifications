# Email And SMS Notifications

Twilio’s SMS and SendGrid email APIs are perfect for when you need to let your users know what’s going on in multiple channels. This repo is designed to send an appointment confirmation email using Twilio SendGrid (https://twilio.com/sendgrid). Then on the day of the appointment it'll send an SMS reminder using Twilio Programmable SMS (https://twilio.com/sms).
